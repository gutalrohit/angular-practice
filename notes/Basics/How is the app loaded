/* notes
1. index.html file is the starting point. it calls the main.ts file.
2. main.ts file "bootstraps" (starts) the appmodule. appmodule is generally the module that encloses all the components.
in the AppModule also we mention what will be the component that needs to be bootstraped using 'bootstrap'
3. AppModule is the main module where we register the components or other modules that we have dependency on.
eg formsModule or RoutingModule etc
The modules are the way in angular to share packagable functionalities (module is like plugins in vue)
So, all additional functionalities can be added to the app using modules and registering them in "imports"
4. All components/ modules/ directives are nothing but classes. Typescript decorators like @NgModule, @Component etc add meaning to that calss.
and defines what will it be used as. ALl dependencies are declared in the AppModule.
5. To the decorators we pass an object containing different properties like selector, imports, providers, declarations. ALl the properties are arrays.
